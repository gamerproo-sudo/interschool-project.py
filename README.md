âš¡ Welkom/Welcome to your one and only- Valkyrie bot! 

-What can this bot do?
A lot. But first and foremost, let's get started with the first steps to use this bot.
1: Head to https://discord.com/ and create a account if you haven't. Once you've verified your email address and have a account, move on to step 2.
2: Join this discord server (you can just copy and paste it into the browser): https://discord.gg/UpmfAnhbWd
3: Once you've done so, you can run the bot! To access the commands, head to the "general" channel and type /help and select the option of the Valkyrie bot. 
4: Uncertain about how to use slash commands, don't worry, discord has a guide for that! Head to: https://discord.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-discord-apps?ref=badge

Final checklist:
Install everything in "requirements.txt"
Run the bot. 
Make sure all of the code is appropiately copy and pasted.
And that's it! Everything has been carefully tested for 2 days and has been added with cautiousness. Incase of any issue that uses a API, it may not be the code's fault but the API's fault itself.

That's all, thanks!
